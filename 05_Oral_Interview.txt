Java:
Q. What is the differences between C++ and Java?
A:	1. C++ code runs in a real machine.  Java runs in a virtual machine 
	2. C++ supports unsigned arithmetic.  Java doesn't. 
	3. C++'s parameters can be passed by value, pointer, or by reference.  Java's parameters are always passed by value (or, with objects, their references are passed by value). 
	4. C++ doesn't have garbage collection.  Java has built-in garbage collection 
	5. C++ allows operator overloading. Java does not. 
	6. C++ allows multiple inheritance of classes. Java allows single inheritance, but mutiple inheritance the interfaces. 
	7. C++ has the destructor.  Java does not.

C++:
Q. What is viritual function?
A:	1. A virtual member function in a base class expects to be overridden in a derived class
Q. What is pure virtual function?
A:	1. A pure virtual function is a virtual member function of a base class that must be overridden.
Q. What is abstract base class?
A:	1. An abstract base class is not instantiated, but other classes are derived from it.
	 2. A class becomes an abstract base class when it contains one or more pure virtual functions.

CUDA:
Q. How many different kind of memories are in a GPU?
Q. What means coalesced / uncoalesced?
Q. Can you implement a matrix transpose kernel?
Q. What is a warp?
Q. How many warps can run simultaneously inside a multiprocessor? 
Q. What is the difference between a block and a thread?
Q. Can thread communicate between them? and blocks?
Q. Can you describe how works a cache?
Q. What is the difference between shared memory and registers?
Q. Which algorithms perform better on the gpu? data bound or cpu bound?
Q. Which steps will you perform to port of an application to cuda ?
Q. What is a barrier ? 
Q. What is a Stream ? 
Q. Can you describe what means occupancy of a kernel? 
Q. What means structure of array vs array of structures? 
Local memory is used to store local values that doesn't fit into registers.

If it's a scientific role then expect questions on floating point and numerical accuracy, in particular you should look at the reduction sample in the NVIDIA SDK since that illustrates a whole load of the points in Fabrizio's post too.


"You have N vectors of length M (N>>M). Tell me how you would go about designing a kernel to evaluate the distance matrix. Pay special attention to the way the problem is sub-divided and to the way the thread co-operation can be used to improve occupancy.
How would your answer to this question change if M>>N?"
The idea here is not to get you writing code, but to get you thinking out loud. This shows that you really know how to use GPGPU technology and are not merely regurgitating the user guide.
