Developed by the United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the satellite was in many ways a direct successor to NRL's Project Vanguard, the first American satellite program. 
The satellite's scientific mission was a success, sending useful data through November 1960 that determined normal solar X-ray output and confirmed the connection between increased solar X-ray activity and radio fade-outs.
In 1957 the Soviet Union began deploying the S-75 Dvina surface-to-air missile, controlled by Fan Song fire control radars. 
This development made penetration of Soviet air space by American bombers more dangerous. 
The US Air Force began a program of cataloging the rough location and individual operating frequencies of these radars, using electronic reconnaissance aircraft flying off the borders of the Soviet Union. 
This program provided information on radars on the periphery of the Soviet Union, but information on the sites further inland was lacking. 
Some experiments were carried out using radio telescopes looking for serendipitous Soviet radar reflections off the Moon, but this proved an inadequate solution to the problem.
