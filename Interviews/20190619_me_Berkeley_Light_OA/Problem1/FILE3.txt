The land area of the entire United States is approximately 3,800,000 square miles (9,841,955 km2),[229] with the contiguous United States making up 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2) of that. 
Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856.2 km2). 
Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. 
The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2).[230] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[231]
The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. 
The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.[d] 
The Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, lists the size of the United States as 3,677,649 square miles (9,525,067 km2), as they do not count the country's coastal or territorial waters.[232] The World Factbook, which includes those waters, gives 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,517 km2).[233]
The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[234] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[235] 
The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[235]
Highest peak in the country, Denali
The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[236] 
Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[237] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). 
The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[238] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[
239] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.
Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. 
The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature. 
The United States has the most ecoregions out of any country in the world.[242]
The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. 
To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. 
The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. 
Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. 
The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. 
Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[244] 
Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.
